## Introduction

I started it off to consolidate resources for learning distributed systems, but it is slowly expanding it's wings to cover not only distributed systems, but in general anything that piques my interest.

### Amazon
* [A Conversation with Werner Vogels](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065) - Coverage of Amazon's transition to a service-based architecture.
* [Discipline and Focus](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1388773) - Additional coverage of Amazon's transition to a service-based architecture.
* [Werner Vogels](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/) on [Scalability](http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204944id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1634.html).
* [SOA creates order out of chaos @ Amazon](https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/news/1195702/SOA-creates-order-out-of-chaos-Amazon).

### Latency
* [Latency Exists, Cope!](http://www.addsimplicity.com/adding_simplicity_an_engi/2007/02/latency_exists_.html) - Commentary on coping with latency and it's architectural impacts.
* [Latency - the new web performance bottleneck](https://www.igvita.com/2012/07/19/latency-the-new-web-performance-bottleneck/) - Not at all new (see [Patterson](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1022596)), but noteworthy.
* [The Tail At Scale](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub40801.html) - The challenges inherent of dealing with latency in large scale systems. Alternate [link](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps296.4/fall13/838-CloudPapers/dean_longtail.pdf).

### P2P Systems
* [Chord](http://nms.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord.pdf) - A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications.
* [Kademlia](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) - A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric.
* [Pastry](http://rowstron.azurewebsites.net/PAST/pastry.pdf) - Scalable, decentralized object location and routing for large-scale peer-to-peer systems.
* [PAST](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~druschel/publications/PAST-hotos.pdf) - A large-scale, persistent peer-to-peer storage utility - storage system atop Pastry.
* [SCRIBE](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~druschel/publications/Scribe-jsac.pdf) - A large-scale and decentralised application-level multicast infrastructure - wide area messaging atop Pastry.

### Theory
* [A Cache of Theoretical Papers](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/distributed_systems).

### Miscellaneous 
* [The Value of Science](http://www.faculty.umassd.edu/j.wang/feynman.pdf) - Post involvement in Manhattan Project, Prof. Feynman answers question concerning _Is there evil in science?_
* [Meltdown Attack](https://meltdownattack.com/).
